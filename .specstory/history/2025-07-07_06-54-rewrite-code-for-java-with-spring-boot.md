rewrite for java with springboot example

---

_**Assistant**_

Here’s a revised version of your `home.html` template, rewritten to reference a Java Spring Boot example instead of Go. The content now describes a Spring Boot web server and its integration with DollarDeploy, while keeping the styling and structure intact.

I will update the text content only, as the rest of the HTML (including Tailwind and layout) is already suitable.

Here’s what will change:
- Update the title and headings to reference "Java Spring Boot Example".
- Change the description to mention a Java Spring Boot web server.
- Adjust the DollarDeploy section to reference deploying a Spring Boot app.

Let me make these changes for you.

The `home.html` template has been updated to reference a Java Spring Boot example instead of Go. The title, headings, and description now mention Java Spring Boot, and the DollarDeploy section is tailored for a Spring Boot app.

If you need further customization or want to add dynamic data from your Spring Boot backend, let me know!
